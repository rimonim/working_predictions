# How do Humans Structure Conditionally-Dependent Predictions?
Human-made machines tend to be carefully designed and callibrated for particular situations. But humans themselves are impressibly versatile. One component of this versatility is our ability to "predict" situations that may arise and prepare for them appropriately.

At this point, the behaviorist gets up and walks out. "Predict" is a cognitive concept (and an ill-defined one at that), but most conditionally-dependent behavior can be easily explained in terms of simple stimulus-response associations.
