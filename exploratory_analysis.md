# How do Humans Structure Conditionally-Dependent Predictions?
Human-made machines tend to be carefully designed and callibrated for particular situations. But humans themselves are impressibly versatile. One component of this versatility is our ability to "predict" situations that may arise and prepare for them appropriately.

I write "predict" in scare quotes because prediction is a cognitive concept, and an ill-defined one at that. As we shall see, much of conditionally-dependent behavior can be explained by simple association. 

Experiment 1.1 looks like this:

Experiment 1.2 looks like this:

### Competing Theories

Ness and Meltzer-Asscher (2021)
"At every stage during sentence processing, multiple rep- resentations in long-term memory are pre-activated. Many different factors contribute to the activation level of a word: the context, lexical properties of the word (e.g., frequency), idiosyncratic influences, and random noise. Once the activa- tion level of a certain word reaches a retrieval threshold, this word is regarded as retrieved, which initiates its integration into the sentence's representation being built in WM."
